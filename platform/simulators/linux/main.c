/**
 * Creates all the demo application tasks and co-routines, then starts the
 * scheduler.
 *
 * Main. c also creates a task called "Print".  This only executes every
 * five seconds but has the highest priority so is guaranteed to get
 * processor time.  Its main function is to check that all the other tasks
 * are still operational.  Nearly all the tasks in the demo application
 * maintain a unique count that is incremented each time the task successfully
 * completes its function.  Should any error occur within the task the count is
 * permanently halted.  The print task checks the count of each task to ensure
 * it has changed since the last time the print task executed.  If any count is
 * found not to have changed the print task displays an appropriate message.
 * If all the tasks are still incrementing their unique counts the print task
 * displays an "OK" message.
 *
 * The LED flash tasks do not maintain a count as they already provide visual
 * feedback of their status.
 *
 * The print task blocks on the queue into which messages that require
 * displaying are posted.  It will therefore only block for the full 5 seconds
 * if no messages are posted onto the queue.
 *
 * Main. c also provides a demonstration of how the trace visualisation utility
 * can be used, and how the scheduler can be stopped.
